/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset establishes a security model for a church application,
 * balancing public access to information with secure, context-aware write permissions.
 * Most top-level collections like events and sermons are publicly readable to signed-in
 * users, with writes reserved for future administrative roles. User-generated content
 * like prayer requests follows a "drop-box" model (write-only), ensuring privacy.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into a flat structure with four main
 * top-level collections: /events, /sermons, /testimonies, and /prayer_requests.
 * This segregation simplifies security rules by avoiding complex hierarchical lookups
 * and ensures performant queries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Read Access: Most data is readable by any authenticated user. Anonymous
 *   users have no access.
 * - Admin-Only Writes: Collections like /events and /sermons are intended to be
 *   managed by administrators. As no admin role system is defined in the current
 *   schema, all write operations on these collections are disabled by default as a
 *   security measure.
 * - Testimony Ownership: The rules anticipate that testimonies should be editable only
 *   by their original authors. The data model now includes a secure 'authorId' (UID) field.
 * - Private Prayer Requests: The /prayer_requests collection is configured as a
 *   "write-only" drop box. Any signed-in user can submit a request, but no user
 *   (including the author) can read, update, or delete requests through the client,
 *   ensuring privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: This ruleset is designed with denormalization in
 * mind. For user-owned content (like Testimonies and User Profiles), it is critical that an `authorId` or `uid`
 * field containing the user's UID is stored directly on the document. This avoids
 * slow and costly `get()` calls and is the only secure way to enforce ownership.
